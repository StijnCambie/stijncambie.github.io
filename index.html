<h1>Welcome at the Personal Page of Stijn Cambie</h1>

<img id="SCpic" src="StijnCambiePic.jpeg" alt="One of my profile pictures">


Currently I am employed as a mathematician (funded by FWO) within a computer science department,
but there is no existential crisis as I can be considered as a problem-solver in all regards.
One may also judge based on my <a href="javascript:void();" onclick="showhide('academic background')">Academic Background.</a>
<blockquote id="intro" style="display:none;">
    <br>
I am a former PhD student of <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.r.kang/">Ross Kang</a> at Raboud University Nijmegen, who graduated (cum laude) the 19th of April 2022.<br>
The title of my thesis is "Extremal aspects of distances and colourings in graphs" and one can find both a <a href="https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/248605">full version </a> and a <a href="PhDthesis_StijnCambie_B5_short_volledig.pdf">Short version</a> of it.<br>
The introductory talk has been done in Dutch and has been recorded; <a href="Defensie_lekenpraatje.mp4">Lekenpraatje</a>.<br>

I have been employed as a postdoc before at Warwick University, UK and <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/ecopro">Ecopro</a> at IBS, South-Korea.   <br>

Currently, supported by a FWO postdoctoral fellowship, I work in the <a href="https://kulak.kuleuven.be/nl/onderzoek/Onderzoeksdomeinen/algorithmic-graph-theory">ALGT group</a> at KULAK, Belgium.   <br>
Here I also teach Analysis I and supervise master students.

My main interests and experience are in combinatorics (mostly graph theory), but I am also intruigued by e.g. number theory.<br>
People interested to work together on related things in the future can always contact me.<br>

<h2>Research</h2>

Most of the research papers of me and my coauthors are immediately available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Stijn+Cambie&searchtype=allArxiv">Arxiv</a>.<br>
By the Belgian way of working, recent published papers are also made available as much as possible at <a href="https://kulak.kuleuven.be/nl/onderzoek/Onderzoeksdomeinen/algorithmic-graph-theory/team-members/00097901/view?sortby=scdate&pubsonpage=10&pubtype=journal-article#pubs">Lirias</a>.<br>
Progress on some problems of Erdos, with different (subjective) success, can be found at <a href="https://github.com/StijnCambie/stijncambie.github.io/>erdosproblems.com</a>.<br>
I also reviewed for many journals myself (and did shortly as well for MathScinet and <a href="https://zbmath.org/?q=rn%3A19248">Zbmath</a>).

<b>Teaching activities</b><br>
Before the current teaching of Analysis I, I already encouraged students to process some mathematics.

    
I have taught exercise classes in Leuven as a master student up to May 2017 and in Nijmegen as a PhD student from September 2017 until June 2020.
Now I am teaching analysis I.<br>

, as well as for the VFO.

I am involved with the coordination of the training at the Flemish training camps for the maths olympiads and the selection.
At the BxMO, I have been crew member, leader, PSC member and head of PSC, organisator and chief coordinator.
For the EMC (https://emc.mnm.hr/), I am the local organisator in Belgium, and the only local organisator who has done so in every edition.
I also had the opportunity to teach to some of the most brilliant young problem-solvers at the International Mathematics Summer Camp.
